            <h1>MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h1> <hr><br><hr><br>
            <p>
                My name is Joshua S. Flomo. I was born unto the union of Mr. & Mrs. Flomo. I was born on January 23, 2003 in Gbarnga 
                City, Bong County-Republic of Liberia at the Dumbar Hospital in Gbarnga at the precise hour of 7:30AM Sunday Morning.
                <br><br>
                I began my education at the John Flomo Bakalu Elementary & Junior High School in Gbarnga City, Bong County where 
                I discovered my interest in learning Computer Science. As I continued to the Dolokelen Gboveh High School in Gbarnga
                City, Bong County, I faced challenges and achievements that strengthened my confidence and direction in life. These experiences helped me realize my
                passion for becoming an IT (Information Technology) Student.
                <br><br>
                Over the years, I have developed skills in Website Development, Networking, Database Management and I continue to
                work hard to improve myself. I enjoy being around Computer and I believe that every new experience teaches me 
                something valuable.
                <br><br>
                Today, I am focused on building a strong foundation for my future. My goal is to become a professional IT (Information 
                Technology) specialist, and I am committed to putting in the effort needed to achieve it. I am grateful to God 
                for my journey so far, and I look forward to creating more opportunities for growth, learning and success. <br><br>
